# road_events

This table (formerly the Common Core Data Dictionary) contains information about work zone events.  The information describes where, when, and what activity is taking place along a road segment. This specification currently accommodates work zones; This design accommodates multiple road event types.

This table is related to the [road_event_feed_info](/feed-content/data-tables/road_event_feed_info.md) table by the foreign key feed_info_id.  For every record in the road_event_feed_info table there must exist one or more road_event records.

This table is related to the [types_of_work](/feed-content/data-tables/types_of_work.md) table. For each record in the road_events table there may exist zero or more records in the types_of_work table. The road_event_id field acts as the foreign key in the types_of_work table.

This table is related to the [lanes](/feed-content/data-tables/lanes.md) table. For each record in the road_events table there may exist one or more records in the lanes table. The road_event_id field acts as the foreign key in the lanes table.

## Data Table Structure
Each data table defines a list of data fields which are described by the following characterstics:

- **Field Name** - name of the field or column 
- **Data Type** - identifies the kind of data being stored and indicates if the field’s content is restricted to an enumeration
- **Description** - description of the data content
- **Conformance** - description of the requirement for including data in the data feed file. There are three categories of conformance:
    - *Required* - must be included
    - *Optional* - may be included
    - *Conditional* - associated with two or more data concepts; requires that at least one of the concepts be included in the data feed file
- **Notes** - comments, guidance, or notes for future consideration

**road_name**|Text|Publicly known name of the road on which the event occurs.|Required|
**road_number**|Text|The road number designated by a jurisdiction such as a county, state or interstate|Optional|Examples I-5, VT 133
**direction**|Enumeration; Text|The digitization direction of the road that is impacted by the event. This value is based on the standard naming for US roadways and indicates the direction the traffic flow regardless of the real heading angle. |Required|Example `northbound` (for I-5 North); See [Direction Enumerated Type](/feed-content/enumerated-types/derived-from-its-standards/direction.md)

**beginning_milepost**|Float|The linear distance measured against a milepost marker along a roadway where the event begins|Optional|	A milepost or mile marker is a surveyed distance posted along a roadway measuring the length (in miles or tenth of a mile) from the south west to the north east. These markers are typically notated on State and local government digital road networks. Provide link to description of milepost method in metadata file.
**ending_milepost**|Float|The linear distance measured against a milepost marker along a roadway where the event ends|Optional|A milepost or mile marker is a surveyed distance posted along a roadway measuring the length (in miles or tenth of a mile) from the south west to the north east. These markers are typically notated on State and local government digital road networks. Provide link to description of milepost method in metadata file.
**beginning_accuracy**|Enum: Estimated or Verified|Indicates how the beginning coordinate was defined.|Required|see [Spatial Verification Enumerated Type](/feed-content/enumerated-types/spatial_verification.md)
**ending_accuracy**|Enum: Estimated or Verified|Indicates how the ending coordinate was defined.|Required|see [Spatial Verification Enumerated Type](/feed-content/enumerated-types/spatial_verification.md)
**start_date**|DateTime|The UTC time and date when the event begins.|Required|All date/time formats shall use ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange. Example: `2016-11-03T19:37:00Z`
**end_date**|DateTime|The UTC time and date when the event ends.|Required|All date/time formats shall use ISO 8601 Data elements and interchange formats – Information interchange. Example: `2016-11-03T19:37:00Z`
**start_date_accuracy**|Enum: Estimated or Verified|A measure of how accurate the start Date Time is.|Required|see [Time Verification Enumerated Type](/feed-content/enumerated-types/time_verification.md)
**end_date_accuracy**|Enumeration: Estimated or Verified|A measure of how accurate the end Date Time is.|Required|see [Time Verification Enumerated Type](/feed-content/enumerated-types/time_verification.md)
**event_status** |Enumeration; Text|The status of the event|Optional|See [Event Status Enumerated Type](/feed-content/enumerated-types/event_status.md)
